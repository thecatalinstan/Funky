# Funky

Funky is a status bar utility which allows you to easily toggle the function key on your Mac on a per app basis.

## Usage 

Funky maintains a list of apps for which it will set the function key to standard F1, F2, etc. In order to edit the list, follow the steps below:

1. From the status bar icon trigger the *Preferences* dialog and navigate to *Apps*. 
2. Use the `+` sign to add a new app bundle.
